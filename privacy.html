      </p>

      <h2 class="subtitle1"><strong>Information We Collect from You</strong></h2>
      <p>
        In order for  KredStreet Inc. to provide services to you, KredStreet Inc. must collect certain information from you.  This includes:
        <ol>
          <li>Information that you provide to us whenever you apply for a product or service with KredStreet Inc. , request changes in your service, or contact us about your account or transactions (whether on-line, by email, electronic chat, telephone conversation or any other means).</li>
          <li>Information we collect from your visits to our website, whether or not you open an account or undertake a transaction with us, including your geolocation, equipment type, frequency and length of visits, and other details about your electronic interaction with us.</li>
          <li>Information that we obtain through your use of our services and your participation in our marketing or other customer recruitment and retention programs.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <h2 class="subtitle1"><strong>How We Use Your Information</strong></h2>
      <p>
        We use your information primarily to help us provide the services to you that you request.  For example, we use the bank account information that you provide to enable you to make purchases on our sites and webpages, and we use information about the merchants and other customers to whom you wish to send money in order to fulfill your transaction.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may also use this information to contact you about your account, your use of KredStreet Inc. services, to alert you to potential problems and to respond to your questions to us.  This information also helps us create marketing and other programs that might be interesting to you, and to contact you about them.
      </p>

      <p>
        As required by law, we use your information to help identify and detect money-laundering, fraud and other abuses of the financial system.
      </p>

      <h2 class="subtitle1"><strong>How We Share Your Information</strong></h2>
      <p>
        We may share your information among our affiliates (that is, companies that share our ownership), and with members of the our Third-Party Service Provider network, who help us record and process your transactions.  We may also share your information with credit reporting agencies, banks, card processors, identify verification services and other organizations, but only in order for us to provide you with the services you request.  We may also provide your information to government agencies, regulators, courts and other third parties to help prevent crime or to protect ourselves or our customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        From time to time, we may develop typologies that rely on how you and other customers use our service.  Those typologies do not, however, contain information that is personally identifiable to you.  We may share those typologies with social media companies and advertisers to help us market our services.
      </p>

      <h2 class="subtitle1"><strong>Data Storage and Security</strong></h2>

      </p>
      <p>
        Once we receive your information, we store it with encryption, information security protocols, data protection devices and other means to help us ensure that we are maintaining your information responsibly and in compliance with law.  However, no information that passes over the internet is entirely secure.  Although we do our best to safeguard your information, we cannot guarantee its security against hacks and unauthorized access.  If such an event should occur, however, we will contact you promptly and keep you informed about the incident.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you open an account with KredStreet Inc. , you establish a password and other security protocols to help us confirm your identity when you visit us again.  You are responsible for the security of your password and other identification criteria.  If you lose or forget your log-on information, or if you believe someone else may have access to it or have used it, you should contact us immediately to enable us to help you protect your account.
      </p>


      <h2 class="subtitle1"><strong>Your Rights</strong></h2>
      <p>
        You have certain rights to view, correct, update or delete your personal information you have provided to us.  Your rights depend on where you live.   Because KredStreet Inc. services and/or products may be regulated by various state and federal agencies, we may have an obligation to retain and report your personal information, even after you have ceased doing business with us.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your use of any of KredStreet’s services, and any disputes arising from it, is subject to this Privacy Policy as well as our Terms of Use and all of its dispute resolution provisions including arbitration, limitation on damages and choice of law.

Not all changes may result in an updating of this Notice, which is only a summary to help you understand how we use your information.
