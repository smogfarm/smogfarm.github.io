          <li>Any Claim about us or the Program should be addressed to us in the first instance by contacting Customer Service at (Number or email of customer support/services) .  You should clearly indicate that you are wishing to make a Claim to us.  This helps us to distinguish a Claim from a mere inquiry.

You may request a copy of our Claim procedure at any time by contacting Customer Service.</li>
          <li>If not resolved pursuant to the Agreement sections above, any Claim, including questions involving the scope, interpretation or enforceability of this Agreement, will be settled by binding individual arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association pursuant to its then-current Consumer Arbitration Rules (available at www.adr.org/Rules), and will be arbitrated in Florida, unless you elect to waive any in-person hearing or to conduct proceedings electronically (telephonically or via video conference, if available).  Each party will bear its own attorneys’, experts’ and witness fees.  Arbitration proceedings may not be consolidated with those of other Members.  Neither party will have the right to participate as a member of any class of claimants pertaining to any Claim, and each party expressly waives its right to assert or to participate as a part of any group, class, representative or consolidated claim.  Third parties’ claims will not be joined in any arbitration between the parties.  This Section 26 is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce and will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1-16.  Except to the extent needed to enforce this Section 26 or any arbitral award issued hereunder, the parties waive all rights to a court or jury trial to resolve any claims.</li>
        </ol>
